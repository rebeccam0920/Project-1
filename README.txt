Welcome to building your website!

Here is an example htdocs folder that we'll use in class.

This website will teach you how to use the basic structural elements of HTML5 to build a functioning website. You must master this before you begin styling your site to make it aesthetically pleasing.

Remember: HTML is used to structure a document, while CSS is used to style and position items within the document. While it's tempting to do so when you are first learning, don't use HTML tags to style the document.

You can open the root index.html file in this directory with your browser either with the "ctrl/cmd-O" option, or by dragging the file into your browser window. We're going to use Chrome in class, but you can use any browser you want (except Internet Explorer/Microsoft Edge).
